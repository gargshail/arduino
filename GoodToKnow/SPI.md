#SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface Bus)

Very nice writeup at (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi)

SPI is a synchronous data bus.
Whenever you see clock (SCK) most likely it is a synchronous data transfer


It needs at least three pins

SCK - clock
MOSI -  master output slave input
MISO - master input slave output

It is full duplex because two separate wires for input/output for each device
