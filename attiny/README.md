# Attiny 

## Arduino IDE setup 

(http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

as described in above site

1. If you haven’t already, download the Arduino software, version 1.0.4 (1.0.3 and 1.0.1 should work too, but not 1.0.2). Install the Arduino software, following the instructions for Windows or for Mac OS X.
1. Download the ATiny master.zip file from the link above.
1. Unzip the attiny master.zip file. It should contain an “attiny-master” folder that contains an “attiny” folder.
1. Locate your Arduino sketchbook folder (you can find its location in the preferences dialog in the Arduino software)
1. Create a new sub-folder called “hardware” in the sketchbook folder, if it doesn’t exist already.
1. Copy the “attiny” folder (not the attiny-master folder) from the unzipped ATtiny master.zip to the “hardware” folder. You should end up with folder structure like Documents > Arduino > hardware > attiny that contains the file boards.txt and another folder called variants.
1. Restart the Arduino development environment.
1.You should see ATtiny entries in the Tools > Board menu.
